For each step in this project, be sure to do the following:
- Plan or pseudocode your solution.
- Write the code.
- Test your code to make sure it works.


1. Write the logic to get the computer choice
    Computer is randomly assigned number (0, 1, 2)
    Number is assigned string value (rock, paper, scissors)
    Chosen string value is returned

2. Write the logic to get the human choice
    When user inputs a string (rock, paper, scissors) 
    In prompt method
    Choice is returned

3. Declare the players score variables
    User score starts at 0 variable
    Computer score starts at 0 variable
    When user or computer wins
    Variable is incremented by 1

4. Write the logic to play a single round
    User choice is taken as argument
    Computer choice is taken as argument
    Round winner/loser is announced by string
    In console log
    Winner's score variable is incremented by 1

5. Write the logic to play the entire game
